__doc__ = """Optimizing the performance of Python code involves understanding various factors, 
including execution speed, memory usage, and best practices. 
Here's a detailed overview of performance considerations in Python

* Python's built-in functions and libraries are implemented in C, making them generally faster than custom implementations in pure Python
* List comprehensions and generators are often more efficient than traditional loops for creating lists. They provide concise syntax and can be more memory-efficient
* Accessing global variables is slower than accessing local variables. If a variable is only needed within a function, declare it as a local variable
* Sets have faster membership tests than lists. If you frequently check for membership, consider using sets
* Use profiling tools like cProfile to identify bottlenecks in your code. Focus on optimizing the parts that consume the most time. Tools like timeit can help measure the execution time of specific code snippets
* For numerical and scientific computing, use the NumPy library. NumPy provides highly optimized, vectorized operations that are much faster than equivalent operations on standard Python lists
* Be mindful of memory usage, especially for large datasets. Use generators to produce data on-the-fly, and consider using data streaming libraries for handling large datasets
* Consider using caching techniques, such as memoization, to store and reuse the results of expensive function calls
* Choose the appropriate data structure for your specific use case. For example, use dictionaries for fast lookups and sets for membership tests

# Example: Avoid global variables
def calculate_total(numbers):
    total = 0  # Local variable
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total


# Example: Use sets for membership tests
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
if value in my_set:
    print("Value is in the set.")
